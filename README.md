This repository contains a simple Ruby program that demonstrates a common bug. The bug is that the variable `@value` in the `MyClass` class can hold any data type, not just numbers. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the value is used in a calculation that expects a number. For example, if the value is a string, the calculation may throw an error. The solution shows how to add type checking to prevent this bug.
